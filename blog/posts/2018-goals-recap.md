# 2018 Goals Recap

Last year, I set a goal to write more. I wanted to average one blog post a month. I was too optimistic. And other, unexpected priorities popped up…

*I fear people will think I stole a white baby.*

So how’d I do?


### Success

- **Run a half marathon. **I ran two. And I set a new personal record of 1:46:19 this November.
- **Visit my parents 3 times. **I actually went 4 times. I’m a good son.
- **Submit one paper. **Paper submitted.
- **Write and perform a 3-minute standup act. **I have a video. If you ask nicely, I may share it with you. Or I might save it for another blog post.
- **Read 26 books. **I read exactly [26 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/11394982). Audiobooks while commuting were key.


### Some Progress

- **Spend less time deliberating.** Hard to measure by design. I made some big decisions on the spot (e.g., buying a house), while other decisions involved a lot of deliberating (e.g., becoming a manager).
- **10 pull-ups in a row.** I made it to 7. Fitness goals were deprioritized in order to maintain my sanity while keeping another human alive.
- **15% body fat (average over 7 days). **I was between 17%-18%. I got down to 16%, but now I’m up to 19–20%. Sad.
- **Schedule and maintain regular events with 4 friends/couples. **I had regular events for four-five friends/couples about half the year. Then summer happened and these events quickly fell off the radar.


### Little to no progress

- **Start a blog (avg. 1 post a month). **Big fail. I wrote my list of goals and then nothing. I tried. There are a few half-written drafts from earlier in the year, but perfectionism got in my way.
- **Meditate 5 minutes a day for 300 days. **I did this for a bit, but I’m probably under 100 days of meditation, so I’m gonna call this a failure. I just never got into a rhythm.
- **Read 2 papers a month and write a paragraph for each paper. **Paper reading always takes much more time than I think it will. While I read a dozen papers, I only summarized 3 or 4.
- **Build a style transfer web app from scratch and launch on the cloud. **I didn’t even try.
- **Say no more often. **Another goal that was vague on purpose. I felt overcommitted much of last year, so I think I failed.


### So what about 2019?

I’m working on it. I’ll try to have another post by the end of the month.
