*Numbers are still hard sometimes. Never change AI.*

I know, I know — it’s almost March. The year started off busy, and it doesn’t look like it’s slowing down anytime soon. I wrote these goals at the end of last year, but actually getting them into a blog post took longer than expected.

## Joint Goals

- **Track expenses for 3 months.** Our spending climbed thanks to inflation, lifestyle creep, and kids in private school. We’re committing to a three-month retrospective to understand what’s really happening.
- **Buy a house or plan a remodel.** We either finally find a home within five blocks of where we live or we invest in remodeling the current place.
- **Limit eating out to 3×/week in Seattle.** No counting travel meals, Costco prep, or grocery store food, but we’re reducing restaurant runs while home.
- **Clear out the storage unit.** Renting space is just hiding clutter. Time to sort, organize, and eliminate the extra storage.
- **No buying sweets for ourselves.** Cat loves baked goods and I love candy. We’ll keep them out of the house except for celebrations.
- **18 solo dates.** One or two dates a month keeps us connected, even if we need to catch up after Cat travels.

## Kids

- **Pravin finds a sport he loves.** He’s tried soccer, circus, cross-country, and karate. This is the year we find the right activity.
- **Leela can swim.** Pravin learned last year; this year Leela joins him.
- **Leela reads for fun.** She can read but doesn’t enjoy it yet. Hoping to turn battles into curiosity.
- **Leela learns to ride a bike.** Maybe Pedalheads again, maybe a more patient parent at the lake.
- **Pravin can type.** Keyboard skills still matter. The Typing of the Dead might finally earn its keep.

## Physical

- **Return to dance.** The Century Ballroom is changing, maybe closing. Going 12 times is the goal.
- **Lose two inches off my waist.** Cat bought pants that were (alarmingly) too small. Time to fit them.
- **Run another marathon without injury.** Last year’s “Light at the End of the Tunnel” race ended in PT. This year: finish healthy.

## Personal

- **Two friend trips.** Already knocked out Disney and NYC for Jenny’s 40th.
- **Two family trips.** One is planned for my dad’s side visiting Seattle; Disney might count too.
- **Decorate upstairs.** The space is clean but empty. We need beanbags, toy zones, and a more functional guest room.

## Creative

- **Learn to cook 3 Gujarati dishes.** We found a Gujarati cookbook with papdi no lot; that was the sign.
- **Read 26 books, 4 with Pravin.** Same target as every year, but now we enjoy the same series.
- **12 drop-in art classes.** Found a great local studio — once a month is doable.
- **Update my website and blog.** Same goal as last year. This build-out finally makes it feel real.
- **Secret project.** It’s a skill I’ve always wanted. I’ll share if I make progress; otherwise, maybe next year.
